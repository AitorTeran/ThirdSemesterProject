abstract = {This paper proposes the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) for solving one of the ongoing research challenges in finite set-model predictive control (FS-MPC) of power electronics converters, i.e., the automated selection of weighting factors in cost function. The first step in this approach is to simulate a detailed converter circuit model or run experiments numerous times using different weighting factor combinations. The key performance metrics [e.g., average switching frequency (fsw) of the converter, total harmonic distortion, etc.] are extracted from each simulation. This data is then used to train the ANN, which serves as a surrogate model of the converter that can provide fast and accurate estimates of the performance metrics for any weighting factor combination. Consequently, any arbitrary user-defined fitness function that combines the output metrics can be defined and the weighting factor combinations that optimize the given function can be explicitly found. The proposed methodology was verified on a practical weighting factor design problem in FS-MPC regulated voltage source converter for uninterruptible power supply system. Designed weighting factors for two exemplary fitness functions turned out to be robust to load variations and to yield close to expected performance when applied both to detailed simulation model (less than 3{\%} error) and to experimental test bed (less than 10{\%} error).},

abstract = {We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.},

@article{Dragicevic2019a,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology for automated design of power electronic systems realized through the use of artificial intelligence. Existing approaches do not consider the system's reliability as a performance metric or are limited to reliability evaluation for a certain fixed set of design parameters. The method proposed in this paper establishes a functional relationship between design parameters and reliability metrics, and uses them as the basis for optimal design. The first step in this new framework is to create a nonparametric surrogate model of the power converter that can quickly map the variables characterizing the operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and irradiation) and design parameters (e.g., switching frequency and dc link voltage) into variables characterizing the thermal stress of a converter (e.g., mean temperature and temperature variation of its devices). This step can be carried out by training a dedicated artificial neural network (ANN) either on experimental or simulation data. The resulting network is named as text{\{}ANN{\}}-{\{}1{\}} and can be deployed as an accurate surrogate converter model. This model can then be used to quickly map the yearly mission profile into a thermal stress profile of any selected device for a large set of design parameter values. The resulting data is then used to train text{\{}ANN{\}}-{\{}2{\}}, which becomes an overall system representation that explicitly maps the design parameters into a yearly lifetime consumption. To verify the proposed methodology, text{\{}ANN{\}}-{\{}2{\}} is deployed in conjunction with the standard converter design tools on an exemplary grid-connected PV converter case study. This study showed how to find the optimal balance between the reliability and output filter size in the system with respect to several design constraints. This paper is also accompanied by a comprehensive dataset that was used for training the ANNs.},

@article{Dragicevic2018,
abstract = {This paper proposes the application of a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy in standalone ac microgrids (MGs). AC MGs are usually built from two or more voltage source converters (VSCs) which have the capability of regulating the voltage at the point of common coupling, while sharing the load power at the same time. Those functionalities are conventionally achieved by hierarchical linear control loops. However, they present severe limitations in terms of slow transient response and high sensitivity to parameter variations. This paper aims to mitigate these problems by first introducing an improvement of the FCS-MPC strategy for a single VSC that is based on explicit tracking of derivative of the voltage reference trajectory. Using only a single step prediction horizon, the proposed strategy exhibits very low computational expense, but provides steady-state performance comparable to carrier-based sinusoidal PWM, while its transient response and robustness to parameter variation is far superior to hierarchical linear control. These benefits are exploited in a general ac MG setting where a methodology for paralleling multiple FCS-MPC regulated VSCs is described. Such an MG is characterized by rapid transient response, inherent stability in all operating conditions, and fully decentralized operation of individual VSCs. These findings have been validated through comprehensive simulation and experimental verification.},
