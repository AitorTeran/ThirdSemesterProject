abstract = {This paper proposes the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) for solving one of the ongoing research challenges in finite set-model predictive control (FS-MPC) of power electronics converters, i.e., the automated selection of weighting factors in cost function. The first step in this approach is to simulate a detailed converter circuit model or run experiments numerous times using different weighting factor combinations. The key performance metrics [e.g., average switching frequency (fsw) of the converter, total harmonic distortion, etc.] are extracted from each simulation. This data is then used to train the ANN, which serves as a surrogate model of the converter that can provide fast and accurate estimates of the performance metrics for any weighting factor combination. Consequently, any arbitrary user-defined fitness function that combines the output metrics can be defined and the weighting factor combinations that optimize the given function can be explicitly found. The proposed methodology was verified on a practical weighting factor design problem in FS-MPC regulated voltage source converter for uninterruptible power supply system. Designed weighting factors for two exemplary fitness functions turned out to be robust to load variations and to yield close to expected performance when applied both to detailed simulation model (less than 3{\%} error) and to experimental test bed (less than 10{\%} error).},

Additionally, the study presents ANN application challenges, contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study covers many applications of ANN techniques in various disciplines which include computing, science, engineering, medicine, environmental, agriculture, mining, technology, climate, business, arts, and nanotechnology, etc. The study assesses ANN contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study found that neural-network models such as feedforward and feedback propagation artificial neural networks are performing better in its application to human problems. Therefore, we proposed feedforward and feedback propagation ANN models for research focus based on data analysis factors like accuracy, processing speed, latency, fault tolerance, volume, scalability, convergence, and performance. Moreover, we recommend that instead of applying a single method, future research can focus on combining ANN models into one network-wide application.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function , which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regu-larization functions and domain constraints.

abstract = {A new adaptive backpropagation (BP) algorithm based on Lyapunov stability theory for neural networks is developed in this paper. It is shown that the candidate of a Lyapunov function V(k) of the tracking error between the output of a neural network and the desired reference signal is chosen first, and the weights of the neural network are then updated, from the output layer to the input layer, in the sense that $\Delta$V(k) = V(k) - V(k-1) {\textgreater} 0. The output tracking error can then asymptotically converge to zero according to Lyapunov stability theory. Unlike gradient-based BP training algorithms, the new Lyapunov adaptive BP algorithm in this paper is not used for searching the global minimum point along the cost-function surface in the weight space, but it is aimed at constructing an energy surface with a single global minimum point through the adaptive adjustment of the weights as the time goes to infinity. Although a neural network may have bounded input disturbances, the effects of the disturbances can be eliminated, and asymptotic error convergence can be obtained. The new Lyapunov adaptive BP algorithm is then applied to the design of an adaptive filter in the simulation example to show the fast error convergence and strong robustness with respect to large bounded input disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

This paper has two main objectives. The first objective is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) vector control strategy for an LCL-filter based single-phase solar inverter. The ANN controller is trained to implement optimal control, based on approximate dynamic programming. The second objective is to evaluate the performance of the ANN-based solar PV system by simulating the PV system behavior for grid integration and maximum power extraction from solar PV array in a realistic residential PV application and building an experimental solar PV system for hardware validation. The results demonstrate that a residential PV system using the ANN control outperforms the PV system using the conventional standard vector control method and proportional resonant control method in both simulation and hardware implementation. This is also true in the presence of noise, disturbance, distortion, and nonideal conditions.},

To overcome the inapplicability of the optimal GCC controller under practical conditions, a new RNN controller with an improved input structure is proposed to approximate the ideal optimal controller. The performance of an ideal optimal controller and a well-trained RNN controller was compared in close to real-life power converter switching environments, demonstrating that the proposed RNN controller can achieve close to ideal optimal control performance even under low sampling rate conditions. The excellent performance of the proposed RNN controller under challenging and distorted system conditions further indicates the feasibility of using an RNN to approximate optimal control in practical applications.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the application of a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy in standalone ac microgrids (MGs). AC MGs are usually built from two or more voltage source converters (VSCs) which have the capability of regulating the voltage at the point of common coupling, while sharing the load power at the same time. Those functionalities are conventionally achieved by hierarchical linear control loops. However, they present severe limitations in terms of slow transient response and high sensitivity to parameter variations. This paper aims to mitigate these problems by first introducing an improvement of the FCS-MPC strategy for a single VSC that is based on explicit tracking of derivative of the voltage reference trajectory. Using only a single step prediction horizon, the proposed strategy exhibits very low computational expense, but provides steady-state performance comparable to carrier-based sinusoidal PWM, while its transient response and robustness to parameter variation is far superior to hierarchical linear control. These benefits are exploited in a general ac MG setting where a methodology for paralleling multiple FCS-MPC regulated VSCs is described. Such an MG is characterized by rapid transient response, inherent stability in all operating conditions, and fully decentralized operation of individual VSCs. These findings have been validated through comprehensive simulation and experimental verification.},
