abstract = {This paper proposes the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) for solving one of the ongoing research challenges in finite set-model predictive control (FS-MPC) of power electronics converters, i.e., the automated selection of weighting factors in cost function. The first step in this approach is to simulate a detailed converter circuit model or run experiments numerous times using different weighting factor combinations. The key performance metrics [e.g., average switching frequency (fsw) of the converter, total harmonic distortion, etc.] are extracted from each simulation. This data is then used to train the ANN, which serves as a surrogate model of the converter that can provide fast and accurate estimates of the performance metrics for any weighting factor combination. Consequently, any arbitrary user-defined fitness function that combines the output metrics can be defined and the weighting factor combinations that optimize the given function can be explicitly found. The proposed methodology was verified on a practical weighting factor design problem in FS-MPC regulated voltage source converter for uninterruptible power supply system. Designed weighting factors for two exemplary fitness functions turned out to be robust to load variations and to yield close to expected performance when applied both to detailed simulation model (less than 3{\%} error) and to experimental test bed (less than 10{\%} error).},

abstract = {This paper proposes the application of a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy in standalone ac microgrids (MGs). AC MGs are usually built from two or more voltage source converters (VSCs) which have the capability of regulating the voltage at the point of common coupling, while sharing the load power at the same time. Those functionalities are conventionally achieved by hierarchical linear control loops. However, they present severe limitations in terms of slow transient response and high sensitivity to parameter variations. This paper aims to mitigate these problems by first introducing an improvement of the FCS-MPC strategy for a single VSC that is based on explicit tracking of derivative of the voltage reference trajectory. Using only a single step prediction horizon, the proposed strategy exhibits very low computational expense, but provides steady-state performance comparable to carrier-based sinusoidal PWM, while its transient response and robustness to parameter variation is far superior to hierarchical linear control. These benefits are exploited in a general ac MG setting where a methodology for paralleling multiple FCS-MPC regulated VSCs is described. Such an MG is characterized by rapid transient response, inherent stability in all operating conditions, and fully decentralized operation of individual VSCs. These findings have been validated through comprehensive simulation and experimental verification.},
