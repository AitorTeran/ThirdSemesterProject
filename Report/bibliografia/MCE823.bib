abstract = {A new sensorless field-oriented control of direct-drive permanent-magnet synchronous motors based on ldquosliding moderdquo has been studied and applied to domestic washing machine drives. To achieve speed control requirements for the application, a novel sliding-mode observer has been developed by applying the technique of feedback of the ldquoequivalent control.rdquo Armed with the developed algorithms, this observer is able to minimize the estimation error of rotor position at low speeds and guarantee fast convergence of the observer at high speeds in the flux-weakening region. As such, this sensorless control is suitable for domestic washing machine drives demanding wide-speed-range operation. The proposed sensorless control algorithms are implemented in a cost-effective digital controller and tested in a selected prototype washing machine. Both computer simulation and experimental results are illustrated for verification.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an implementation of a motion-sensorless control system in wide speed range based on "active flux" observer, and direct torque and flux control with space vector modulation (DTFC-SVM) for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM), without signal injection. The concept of "active flux" (or "torque producing flux") turns all the rotor salient-pole ac machines into fully nonsalient-pole ones. A new function for Lq inductance depending on torque is introduced to model the magnetic saturation. Notable simplification in the rotor position and speed estimation is obtained, because the active flux position is identical with the rotor position. Extensive experimental results are presented to verify the principles and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sensorless control system. With the active flux observer, the IPMSM drive system operates from very low speed of 2 r/min at half full-load up to 1400 r/min. Higher speed is possible, in principle, with flux weakening.},

abstract = {In this paper, a simple signal injection method is proposed for sensorless control of permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) at a low speed, which ideally requires one voltage vector only for position estimation. The proposed method is easy to implement, resulting in low computation burden. No filters are needed for extracting the high-frequency current signals for position estimation. The use of low-pass filters (LPFs) in the current control loop to obtain the fundamental current component is not necessary. Therefore, the control bandwidth of the inner current control loop may not need to be sacrificed. The proposed method may also be further developed to inject two opposite voltage vectors to reduce the effects of inverter voltage error on the position estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with other sensorless control method. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are given for validating the proposed new sensorless control method.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid motion- sensorless control system for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) using a new robust start-up method called I-f control, and a smooth transition to emf-based vector control. The I-f method is based on separate control of id, iq currents with the reference currents id* = 0 and iq* constant, and the reference frequency having ramp variation. This solution allows ultra low- speed sensorless control without initial rotor-position estimation, and without machine parameters identification. A first-order lag compensator is employed to ensure a smooth transition from I-f to emf sensorless vector control when the frequency reaches a certain level, and back. The PMSM rotor position and speed are extracted by using a PLL state-observer from the estimated rotor-flux, which is based on an equivalent integrator in close- loop with a PI speed-adaptive compensator to eliminate dc-offset and phase-delay. Digital simulations for PMSM start-up with full load torque are presented for different initial rotor-positions. The transitions from I-f to emf motion-sensorless vector control and back as well, at very low-speeds, are fully validated by experimental results. This method is suitable for both surface and interior PMSMs, but the paper refers directly only to surface PMSM. Other field of application might be in wind generators safe (faster) self-starting when they are connected to the grid, or moving the rotor a little for inspections/repairs, and for general industrial variable speed drives where slightly hesitant but full- load self-starting is allowable.},

abstract = {Currently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is considered to be the most sensitive marker available for prostate cancer detection and for monitoring of disease progression. In addition to its importance as a tumor marker, PSA has a role in the biological activity of cancer growth and proliferation. Therefore, the inhibition or activation of its biological activity may be used in prostate cancer therapy. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of new 2′F-modified RNA aptamers directed against PSA. Binding studies demonstrate the ability of these new aptamers to specifically recognize their target with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the selected aptamers, an apta-PCR approach was used for the quantitative detection of PSA, achieving a limit of detection of 11 nM. Furthermore, the potential use of the selected aptamers in therapeutics was demonstrated with the 2′F-modified aptamers being highly stable in human serum and having the ability to moderate the activity of PSA, which will be explored for the treatment of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {This study proposes a novel high-performance rotor position estimator for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). By suitably processing the mathematical model of the motor, a systematic method of the rotor position estimating method has been developed. The proposed control system can be used in the space vector pulse-width modulation switching method, which is widely used in industry. By measuring the DC-bus voltage and the phase currents, a systematic rotor position estimator has been developed. Finally, the rotor position and rotor speed are obtained, and a closed-loop control system can be achieved. A digital signal processor, TMS 320F2812, is used to execute the estimating algorithm and control algorithm. As a result, the hardware is very simple. Several experimental results show that both the position control system and the adjustable speed control system are achieved. The system can be adjusted from 1 to 2000 r/min. In addition, by using the proposed position-loop H∞ controller, the position control system can be achieved with satisfactory performance.

abstract = {Rotor and stator flux orientations are now standard concepts in vector and direct torque control of ac drives. The salient-pole rotor machines, where magnetic saturation plays a key role, still pose notable problems in flux, rotor position and speed estimations for motion-sensorless control, especially in the low-speed range (below 30 rpm in general), leading to numerous dedicated state observers. This letter introduces a rather novel (or generalization) concept-{\textless}i{\textgreater}active{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}flux{\textless}/i{\textgreater} or {\textless}i{\textgreater}torque-producing{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}flux{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-and its utilization in all ac drives by employing a unified state observer for motion-sensorless control in a wide speed range. The active-flux concept turns all salient-pole traveling field machines into nonsalient-pole ones. The active-flux vector is aligned to the rotor {\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}/i{\textgreater} axis for all synchronous machines and to the rotor-flux vector axis for induction machines. This way, the rotor position and speed observer seems more amenable to a wide speed range, with smaller dynamic errors. This observer, based on the active-flux concept, is pretty much the same for all ac drives. An example of implementation for an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor with weak permanent magnets and large magnetic saliency that compares very favorably with respect to most signal injection methods, down to 1 rpm and up to 4000 rpm, is provided through digital simulations. Experiments are under way.},

In this paper, a new concept of using a constant artificial inductance to replace the actual varying machine inductance for position estimation is introduced. This facilitates greatly the analysis of the influence of inductance variation on the estimated position error, and gives a deep insight into this problem. It also provides a simple approach to achieve a globally minimized position error. A proper choice of the artificial machine inductance may reduce the maximum position error by 50{\%} without considering the actual inductance variation in the control algorithm.

abstract = {This paper proposes a sensorless speed control strategy for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) based on a new sliding-mode observer (SMO), which substitutes a sigmoid function for the signum function with a variable boundary layer. In order to apply a sensorless PMSM control which is robust against parameter fluctuations and disturbances, a high-speed SMO is proposed, which estimates the rotor position and the angular velocity from the back EMF. In the conventional SMO, a low-pass filter and an additional position compensation of the rotor are used to reduce the chattering problem that is commonly found in the SMO using the signum function. In order to overcome the time delay caused by the low-pass filter, in this research, a sigmoid function is used for the switching function instead of the signum function. Also, the variation in the stator resistance is estimated to improve the steady-state performance of the SMO. The stability of the proposed SMO was verified using the Lyapunov second method to determine the observer gain. The validity of the proposed high-speed PMSM sensorless velocity control has been demonstrated with simulations and real experiments.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid motion- sensorless control system for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) using a new robust start-up method called I-f control, and a smooth transition to emf-based vector control. The I-f method is based on separate control of id, iq currents with the reference currents id* = 0 and iq* constant, and the reference frequency having ramp variation. This solution allows ultra low- speed sensorless control without initial rotor-position estimation, and without machine parameters identification. A first-order lag compensator is employed to ensure a smooth transition from I-f to emf sensorless vector control when the frequency reaches a certain level, and back. The PMSM rotor position and speed are extracted by using a PLL state-observer from the estimated rotor-flux, which is based on an equivalent integrator in close- loop with a PI speed-adaptive compensator to eliminate dc-offset and phase-delay. Digital simulations for PMSM start-up with full load torque are presented for different initial rotor-positions. The transitions from I-f to emf motion-sensorless vector control and back as well, at very low-speeds, are fully validated by experimental results. This method is suitable for both surface and interior PMSMs, but the paper refers directly only to surface PMSM. Other field of application might be in wind generators safe (faster) self-starting when they are connected to the grid, or moving the rotor a little for inspections/repairs, and for general industrial variable speed drives where slightly hesitant but full- load self-starting is allowable.},

abstract = {Friction force models play a fundamental role for simulation of mechanical systems. Their choice affects the matching of numerical results with physically observed behavior. Friction is a complex phenomenon depending on many physical parameters and working conditions, and none of the available models can claim general validity. This paper focuses the attention on well-known friction models and offers a review and comparison based on numerical efficiency. However, it should be acknowledged that each model has its own distinctive pros and cons. Suitability of the model depends on physical and operating conditions. Features such as the capability to replicate stiction, Stribeck effect, and pre-sliding displacement are taken into account when selecting a friction formulation. For mechanical systems, the computational efficiency of the algorithm is a critical issue when a fast and responsive dynamic computation is required. This paper reports and compares eight widespread engineering friction force models. These are divided into two main categories: those based on the Coulomb approach and those established on the bristle analogy. The numerical performances and differences of each model have been monitored and compared. Three test cases are discussed: the Rabinowicz test and other two test problems casted for this occurrence.},

abstract = {-This paper describes a simple control for a perma-nent motor drive that provides a wide speed range without use of a shaft sensor. Two line-to-line voltages and two stator currents are sensed and processed in analog form to produce the stator flux linkage space vector. The angle of this vector is then used in a microcontroller to produce the appropriate stator current command signals for the hysteresis current controller of the inverter so that near unity power factor can be achieved over a wide range of torque and speed. A speed signal is derived from the rate of change of angle of the flux linkage. A drift compensation program is proposed to avoid calculation errors in the determination of angle position and speed. The control system has been implemented on a 5-kW motor using Nd-Fe-B magnets. The closed-loop speed control has been shown to be effective down to a frequency less than 1 Hz, thus providing a wide range of speed control. An open-loop starting program is used to accelerate the motor up to this limit fre-quency with minimum speed oscillation.},

An adaptive algorithm for online tuning the sliding-mode coefficients of STA-SMO is proposed based on the existing stable conditions. Thus, position estimation error can be reduced by the proposed adaptive algorithm in wide-speed range. Furthermore, voltage distortion due to VSI nonlinearity is online compensated to improve the accuracy of PMSM model. Because mismatch between reference and actual voltage due to VSI nonlinearity may bring large rotor position and speed estimation error, especially in low-speed range where distorted voltages may become dominant compared to actual voltages. Thus, a STA-SMO with adaptive sliding-mode coefficients and accurate voltage value could be obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive STA-SMO with online VSI nonlinearity compensation is verified on a surface-mounted PMSM by experiments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. For low-speed sensorless Surface mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (SPMSM) drives, the position is often estimated based on the rotor magnet saliency. Magnetic field distortion caused by load current may change the orientation of the rotor magnet saliency and it is therefore no longer aligned with the rotor mechanical saliency. This paper analyzes the cross-saturation effects caused by load current influence on SPMSM sensorless drives with respect to position estimation error; a new method is proposed to reliably detect the saturation dependent position estimation error that may influence the performance of sensorless SPMSM drives. Motor parameters are not required in the proposed saturation dependent position estimation error detection method and there is no need to lock the rotor. The method is suitable to use at any initial rotor position without causing noticeable rotor movement. Experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

It can cover a wide speed operating range and was considered to be able to solve the dc drift and initial value problems associated to the pure integrator used in the observer. However, it is reported in this paper that this popular CLFO cannot always work as expected. In some situations, steady state dc-offset cannot be removed by this flux observer, causing large system oscillation at fundamental fre-quency and is very harmful to the drive system. This important issue has not been reported and discussed in the existing literature for the CLFO.
