Dear all

For the mini project, you can document your work in a paper format (8 pages):

    A brief abstract and introduction.
    Mathematical explanation of the method.
    Control scheme figure showing how you implement the injection and do the signal-processing. (You should NOT include a large figure showing the complete Simulink model with all detail. If you check similar papers, you will rarely find that Simulink figures are included in the paper.)
    Simulation results

     use the real speed and position as feedback in FOC and show the estimated position and speed at different low speeds (e.g. 0 rpm, 100 rpm, 500 rpm), at steady state and rated step load torque change conditions (i.e. 0 to rated load torque and than back to 0 torque again).
     repeat 1. but for 100 rpm only, with the real speed and estimated position as feedback in your FOC.

    Discuss / interpret the results.
    Conclusion

The deadline will be sometime in Dec ( I will figure out a date later on).

Best regards
Kaiyuan
